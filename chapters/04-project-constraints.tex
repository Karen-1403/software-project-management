\chapter{Project Time, Scope, and Cost Constraints}

\vspace{12pt}

\noindent This chapter defines the triple constraints of project management—time, scope, and cost—which form the foundation for project planning and control. These constraints are interdependent and must be carefully balanced to ensure project success.

% ============================================================================
\section{Time Constraints}

\par The project timeline is governed by academic calendar requirements and institutional needs. The following temporal constraints apply to this project:

\subsection{Project Duration}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Total Project Duration:} [X] months (e.g., 8 months)
    \item \textbf{Project Start Date:} [Insert Date]
    \item \textbf{Project Completion Date:} [Insert Date]
    \item \textbf{Production Deployment Date:} Must be completed [X] weeks before registration period begins
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Critical Deadlines}

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Requirements Finalization:} Week 4
    \item \textbf{Design Approval:} Week 8
    \item \textbf{Development Completion:} Week 20
    \item \textbf{Testing Completion:} Week 26
    \item \textbf{User Training:} Week 28
    \item \textbf{System Go-Live:} Week 30
    \item \textbf{Registration Period Start:} Week 32 (hard deadline)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Time Constraint Factors}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Registration period start date is non-negotiable and externally imposed
    \item Academic calendar dictates when the system must be operational
    \item Limited availability of stakeholders during semester breaks
    \item Peak registration periods require system to be fully functional
    \item Training must be completed before semester start
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Schedule Flexibility}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Buffer Time:} 2 weeks built into schedule for unforeseen delays
    \item \textbf{Fast-Tracking Opportunities:} Some testing activities can overlap with development
    \item \textbf{Crashing Possibilities:} Additional resources can be allocated to critical path activities if needed
    \item \textbf{Non-Negotiable Deadline:} Final deployment must occur before registration period
\end{itemize}

\section{Constraint Priorities and Trade-offs}

\par In case of conflicts between constraints, the following priority order applies:

\subsection{Constraint Priority Matrix}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Constraint Priorities}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|p{8cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Priority} & \textbf{Constraint} & \textbf{Rationale} \\
\hline
1 & Time & Registration deadline is non-negotiable; missing it causes major institutional impact \\
\hline
2 & Scope & Core functionality must be delivered; system must be usable for students \\
\hline
3 & Cost & Budget has some flexibility; additional funding may be available if justified \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Trade-off Scenarios}

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{If timeline is at risk:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Consider reducing scope (move non-critical features to Phase 2)
        \item Allocate additional resources (increase cost)
        \item Fast-track or crash critical activities
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{If budget is at risk:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Reduce scope to fit within budget
        \item Extend timeline to reduce resource intensity
        \item Utilize more cost-effective resources or technologies
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{If scope must expand:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Request additional budget and/or timeline extension
        \item Evaluate impact on quality and prioritize features
        \item Consider phased implementation approach
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reporting Requirements}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Weekly status reports on schedule adherence
    \item Bi-weekly budget variance reports
    \item Monthly comprehensive project status reports
    \item Immediate escalation of constraint violations exceeding tolerances
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Corrective Actions}

\par When constraints are at risk of being violated:

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Identify root cause of variance
    \item Develop corrective action plan
