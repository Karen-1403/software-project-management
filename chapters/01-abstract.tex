\noindent This document presents a comprehensive project management plan for the development of an Online Course Registration Portal. The system aims to streamline the student course registration process by incorporating advanced features such as prerequisite checking, waitlist management, and automated timetable conflict detection.

\par The project addresses critical challenges in academic course management, including rule enforcement for course prerequisites, handling concurrent registration requests, and ensuring scalable system design to accommodate growing user demands. The portal will enable students to efficiently browse available courses, register for classes while respecting academic constraints, and manage their academic schedules effectively.

\par This report provides detailed analysis across multiple project management dimensions, including project planning, scheduling, resource allocation, cost estimation, risk management, and financial analysis. The document follows industry-standard project management methodologies and employs various analytical tools such as Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), Gantt charts, Activity-on-Node (AON) networks, PERT analysis, and critical path method to ensure comprehensive project planning and successful execution.

\par The intended audience for this document includes project stakeholders, development teams, academic administrators, and project evaluators who require a thorough understanding of the project scope, timeline, resources, and deliverables.
