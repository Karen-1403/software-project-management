\par This report summarizes key aspects of project management, including planning, scheduling, resource allocation, and risk management. It uses standard tools like Gantt charts, WBS and others to support effective project execution.

\par The intended audience for this document includes project stakeholders, development teams, academic administrators, and project evaluators who require a thorough understanding of the project scope, timeline, resources, and deliverables.
